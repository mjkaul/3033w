**About this calendar:**

- “Due” means do these things for class that day. In other words, complete them before class on the day they are listed.
- “Topics” are the topics we’ll cover in class that day.
- All readings are either included in the course packet (CP), linked to here, or uploaded to [our section’s Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rRgRBVoKCMB4XZdV-NvXSEZeYJzvyY3I?usp=sharing).
- Bring your course packet to every class.
- The calendar is subject to change so pay attention during class and, if you miss a class meeting, email one of your colleagues (i.e. not me) to find out what you missed.
