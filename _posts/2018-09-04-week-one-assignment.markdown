Welcome to 3033W: Business Communications. I look forward to meeting each of you at our first course meeting, which will be next Monday, 9/10, from 5:45 to 8:15 pm. We'll meet in CSOM 2-228.

Your assignment for Monday's class is two-fold:

1. Purchase the two required texts for the course: the course packet (*make sure you get one with my name on it; they're not all the same*) and Alan Jacobs's book *How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds*. 
2. Read the syllabus and pages 1-44 in your course packet. These readings will be in our shared Drive folder, which you should have access to soon.

Email me if you have any questions: kaul0038@umn.edu

Again, I'm looking forward to seeing you all on Monday. Until then, I hope your first week of classes goes well.

Regards,

Matt
