I just received word from the bookstore that the course packets aren't ready yet, and may not be ready in time for Monday's class. Please use the files available here ([syllabus](http://mjkaul.github.io/3033w/files/syllabus-f18.pdf) and [course packet](http://mjkaul.github.io/3033w/files/reading-f18-w1.pdf)) to complete your reading assignment for Monday.
