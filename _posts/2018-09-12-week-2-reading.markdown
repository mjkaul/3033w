Remember: your course packets are now available in the bookstore. I’ll expect that you’ll all have a copy by next Monday’s class. But, if for whatever reason you aren’t able to buy a copy right away and you’d like to get started on the reading, I’ve posted [this week’s Course Packet reading](http://mjkaul.github.io/3033w/files/reading-f18-w2.pdf) to the site.

You also have a short reading from the Jacobs book—pages 11–30.

Please be in contact with me this week as questions about the intro speech assignment come up. My email address is on page vii of the course packet.
