I received notice that your course packets are now available in the bookstore. Please make sure you have a copy by this evening's class. While you're there, don't forget to also buy a copy of Alan Jacobs's *How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds*.

I'm looking forward to meeting you all tonight.
