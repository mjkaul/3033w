A couple of reminders as you prepare for your persuasive speeches:

- Upload your visual aids & takeaway document to Canvas **before your speech**
- Meet in Hanson Hall, L-132
     - Come a few minutes early to make sure that the technology works
- Bring the following things:
     - Copies of your take-away document for everyone in your group (including Brooke and me)
     - Your slides (emailed and/or on a flash drive) or your laptop
     - CP 67â€“70 (grading criteria) and CP 73 (peer speech critique)
