This page is for me to keep track of errors I find and want to fix in the course packet.

If you find any errors, please let me know. I’ll add them here and fix them for the next time I teach the course.

- p. 11 – unnecessary space between “less-” and “conscious”
- p. 22 – change the en dash to an em dash in bullet two of the “Be positive and polite” section
- p. 33 – inconsistent spacing between “2” and “3” in both instances
