This page is for me to keep track of errors I find and want to fix in the course packet.

If you find any errors, please let me know. I’ll add them here and fix them for the next time I teach the course.

- p. 1 – the dates for TED and deck assignments should be switched: the TED row is due on 10/1; the deck and deck speech rows are due on 10/8
- p. 11 – unnecessary space between “less-” and “conscious”
- p. 22 – change the en dash to an em dash in bullet two of the “Be positive and polite” section
- p. 33 – inconsistent spacing between “2” and “3” in both instances 
- p. 88-89 – conclusion to sample proof is not supported by the latest [evidence](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2667071)
- p. 141 – topic 7 is missing a “4” after “13”; update the list with the topics from the F18 worksheet
- Persuasive speech section – remove the requirement for slides to be printed
- p. 223 – reword the sentence about audience so that it’s clear that they need to pay careful attention to the audience, but don’t prescribe anything in particular. This changes almost every semester, and always after the course packet is printed.
