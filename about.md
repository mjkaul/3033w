MGMT 3033W: Business Communications that will help you improve your writing, speaking, and critical thinking. You’ll do this through discussions, speeches, and writing assignments that simulate and help you reflect upon business communication.

The course meets weekly on Monday evenings, from 5:45 – 8:15 p.m, in CSOM 2-228.

Two books are required for the course; two others are optional:

## Required

We’ll use these books regularly in class, so don’t just buy them, bring them to each class meeting:

- A course packet, available from the campus bookstore. Make sure you purchase a copy with my name on it—it’s different in important ways from other instructors’ packets.
- Alan Jacobs, *How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds*

## Optional

These two basic reference books will help you throughout the semester—and long after you leave class.

- [Garner’s Modern English Usage](http://a.co/6CqxyE6): simply put, this is the best book on how to use English well. It will answer any question you have about grammar, confusing or confused words, and much else besides. Highly recommended!
- A [good dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com): Merriam Webster is online, free, and overall quite good.
