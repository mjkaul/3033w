- “Due” means do these things for class today. In other words, complete them before class on the day they are listed.
- “Topics” are the topics we’ll cover in class that day.
- All readings are either in the course packet (CP) or posted on the course Moodle site.
- Bring your course packet to every class.
- The calendar is subject to change so pay attention during class and, if you miss a class meeting, email one of your colleagues (i.e. not me) to find out what you missed.

## Books
---

Two books are required for the course; two others are optional:

# Required

We’ll use these books regularly in class, so don’t just buy them, bring them to each class meeting:

- A copy of my course packet, available from the campus bookstore. **Make sure you purchase a copy with my name on it—it’s different in important ways from other instructors’ packets.**
- Alan Jacobs, [*How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds*](http://howtothinkbook.com)
- Various readings and resources that I’ll make available to you.

# Optional

These two basic reference books will help you throughout the semester—and long after you leave class.

- [Garner’s Modern English Usage](http://a.co/6CqxyE6): Simply put, this is the best book on how to use English well. It will answer any question you have about grammar, confusing or confused words, and much else besides. Highly recommended!
- A [good dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com): Merriam Webster is online, free, and overall quite good.
